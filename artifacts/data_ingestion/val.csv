Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Hoofddorppleinbuurt,22,23,"['email', 'phone']",t,f,"Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Netherlands",Oud-Noord,,52.38976,4.91841,Private room in serviced apartment,Private room,2,,1 private bath,,1.0,[],$154.00,1,99,1,3,7,7,1.2,7.0,,t,11,30,57,179,2023-12-12,41,4,1,2019-04-06,2023-11-19,4.63,4.73,4.73,4.68,4.61,4.61,4.44,Exempt,t,22,4,12,0,0.72

Thanks for your interest in our cosy appartment.

I'm a photographer, creative director and internet entrepreneur.
In my 15 years of experience in the media industry I worked with several national and international advertising agencies and production companies. 

We enjoy living in Amsterdam with our little terrier dog Toto. Our favorite thing to do is go shopping delicious food at the local market and then cook and sit and eat on our balcony in the evening sun.

Me and my daughter welcome you to stay.

Best,

I travelled over 70 countries and have a good idea what you need; a clean, warm and cosy place without to much distraction.
A warm shower and a place to prepare some food helps you to stay on your budget and in summer a little place to sit outside.

I love to meet people and talk about the way we fill in our daily life. Often we see that we have many things in common and yet we are so different.

I have many local tips, if you like to make the most of the free things Amsterdam has plenty to offer but you can also go all out as you can read in my local guidebook here on Airbnb.

Feel free to ask me any questions and I'm sure to find an answer. I love to help you plan your trip.

My name is Ronel, I am 26 years old and live in my New Studio in Amsterdam. The place was build ( finish ) in July 2015 and is in the most ""cosy"" part of Amsterdam ( West side ).

The West side of Amsterdam is known for a really young and hip area of the city, it is inside the highway ring ( binnen de ring ) as we Dutch call it.

I have a Girlfriend, but we don't live together. When I am not available she will be your contact if there is something wrong. 

Like you I like to travel around the world and Europe, I dive in countries where it is warm because the Dutch really don't like the cold. Good food and good wine addit to my travel and I am a happy person.

When you come to Amsterdam and book a stay in my appartment, you wil find the ""Card for success"" in the Keuken ( keuken is kitchen ). Don't worry, all good tips about nice restaurants and Nightlife are on this, just like some safety procedures you will need to read.

If you book my appartment I will make shure you will feel home in the city, so lets hope we will see you in Amsterdam. 

Don't forget to read the ""Card for success"" and take notice of the safety procedures!

Enjoy your stay

I am Guiseppe and I love to host the stay of Airbnb travelers!  I am an experienced host which loves to take good care of his guests.

I am really familiar in Amsterdam so I can be a great guide for directions, cool places to stay to make sure you will have a great time.

I am an entrepreneur working on a Card Game with real Girls for IOS and Android. In the living room I have my studio which doesn't make loud noise. From the living room I stream the progress of my game on the Internet. Sometimes with kind quests who know I run an AirBNBN.  Feel free to be my guest if you are familiar with game or talk with the guests. We are all kind people.

When I work in the apartment it's always nights from 22:00 till 05:00 AM. I use that time to also clean the apartment and make it convenient for the guests when they wake up it's clean and there is enough space for them to use everything they need.

Looking forward hosting your stay!

I enjoy going out meeting new people and learning as much as possible from them.

I spend my time between Amsterdam and Lisbon. If I am in Lisbon , my son Edo looks after the house in Amsterdam and I manage a studio that we rent out on a beautiful cliff overlooking the sea just south of Lisbon. 

In Amsterdam, everybody wanted to live on the canals growing up but today the area has been overtaken by noise and partying people. Our house in Amsterdam South became the place to live with very good restaurants,  great shops, Concerthall and all the Musea around the corner including the convenient Airport Shuttle bus 397 which takes and brings you direct from the airport, only a few minute walk from my house. A lot of my guests take a morning jog in the nearby Vondelpark....

I have lived for twenty years abroad and returned  4years ago.
Before that I have been a stewardess with KLM for fourteen years so I can say receiving people comes natural to me :-) and  it is most important that my quests feel at home.

I hope to welcome you in the near future.....

But to be honest, mostly out of a suitcase. :)

I moved to New York 12 years ago to persue a carreer in the modeling industry which causes me to be on a plane most of the time. 
But definitely not minding it as I suffer from a severe case of Wanderlust

I still visit Amsterdam often as all of my family is there and I love them dearly. 
However.. Whenever I'm not around I gladly open my home up to travelers. 
Same goes for New York actually :)

I love to cook, good food, wine, COFFEE
And everything that involves film, art, nature, fashion and history.

My favorite book is Shantaram.
My favorite movie; too many to name
I religiously go to the cinema every sunday.
(not to mention all the inflight movies)

Music; I could not live in a world without music.
And I enjoy opera and ballet very much. 
Unfortunately I do not go too often. 

As a guest I am very thoughtful, punctual and respectful.
I'd like to say as a host I am the same. 

My life motto is Amor Vincit Omnia
Love conquers all

Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Hoofddorppleinbuurt,22,23,"['email', 'phone']",t,f,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",Westerpark,,52.3818,4.87934,Room in serviced apartment,Hotel room,2,,1 private bath,,1.0,[],$167.00,2,1125,1,3,7,7,1.2,7.0,,t,9,24,53,162,2023-12-12,77,22,0,2018-09-25,2023-11-10,4.74,4.83,4.88,4.91,4.9,4.66,4.53,Exempt,t,22,4,12,0,1.21

My husband - Frans - and I have been living in Amsterdam for over 10 years. For us it's the most wonderful city to live in!

I'm Belgian and Frans is a Dutchman. Together we've done quite some traveling. We met in Mallorca, lived together in Ghent, Belgium for 3 years, lived in Istanbul, Turkey for 1/2 year, extensively travelled through Italy & Spain and in 2013 we came back from a 1 year trip around South-America. Though having seen all these beautiful places, Amsterdam has stolen our hearts and we can't imagine living anywhere else but here. Cycling through the city, across the bridges and next to the canals always puts a very large smile on our faces!

Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Hoofddorppleinbuurt,22,23,"['email', 'phone']",t,f,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",Centrum-Oost,,52.37031,4.91141,Room in serviced apartment,Hotel room,2,,1 private bath,,1.0,[],$193.00,1,1125,1,3,7,7,1.2,7.0,,t,14,40,70,203,2023-12-12,28,5,0,2018-10-20,2023-09-19,4.75,4.79,4.89,4.82,4.89,4.75,4.39,Exempt,t,22,4,12,0,0.45

The RAI congress, business centre Zuidas and district de Pijp are just 5 minutes from the apartment. The Van Gogh, Stedelijk and Rijks-museum are 7 minutes away. The centre is 8  minutes away

I work in the film industrie and had one of the leading casting agencies of the Netherlands for 25 years. During this period  i used to travel a lot, where I  participated in many  feature films and television series abroad. Now I work as a Assistant Director in film and I have my B&B. I love to do both very much.  

I love traveling and also have lived abroad. That is how I found out what I needed of a B&B. A home away from home!


One of the things I  really enjoy about my  B&B is to meet travellers  from all around the world and facilitated them so they  have a great time or moment in Amsterdam.

People who have visited my place have all felt very welcome here. 
Please see the reviews.

 It's  a perfect place to relax after a day's work at the RAI or after a day or night  of visiting the town.
 
Please feel free to contact me at any time if you have any questions.

We hope life's treating you well.
It actually does while it seems you are planning a nice trip to the best place on earth; Amsterdam!
And the best part is you are checking out our apartment :)
We (Jasper and Susan) live in Amsterdam with great pleasure the past 20 years. We enjoy the beautiful old houses, boats and cozy cafes and restaurants every day. For the coming years Amsterdam is definitely our homebase, but every now and then we like to make beautiful trips. During these periods we want other people to enjoy our home. We love art and music which recurs by large paintings and photographs (made by ourselves or 'real' artists), the piano and amazing sound system upstairs in the living room.

Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Hoofddorppleinbuurt,22,23,"['email', 'phone']",t,f,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",De Baarsjes - Oud-West,,52.37014,4.86516,Private room in serviced apartment,Private room,2,,1 private bath,,1.0,[],$164.00,1,99,1,3,7,7,1.2,7.0,,t,10,37,62,187,2023-12-12,54,5,0,2018-08-31,2023-10-24,4.91,4.96,4.93,4.87,4.94,4.83,4.72,Exempt,t,22,4,12,0,0.84

Please feel free to contact me for more information.

Kind regards,
Emiel

Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Hoofddorppleinbuurt,22,23,"['email', 'phone']",t,f,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",Westerpark,,52.38512,4.88201,Entire serviced apartment,Entire home/apt,2,,1 bath,,1.0,[],$189.00,1,1125,1,3,7,7,1.2,7.0,,t,13,42,61,188,2023-12-12,57,28,1,2020-02-27,2023-11-15,4.7,4.77,4.88,4.7,4.88,4.79,4.33,Exempt,t,22,4,12,0,1.23

first line of a poem by Roman Emperor Hadrian 138 AC
Meaning Little soul, little wanderer, little charmer.

Once a traveler, always a traveler. If it isn't outbound, it's inward. And it isn't about the destination. It's about the road.  Going up and down, left and right. Sometimes welcoming with lots of comfortable hide aways. Challenging at all times. 

I prefer the word Tao. Literary meaning way, path or route. Because it clarifies the point of traveling which is to cross borders, going beyond the clearly visible, the well sign posted and known world and even beyond the world of physical appearances all together. 

Many years ago I set out traveling to expand my geographical map. I end up expanding my mind map. 

I like to share with you the place I call home. As a resting place for you on your travels through life. 

I manage to earn a living as a yoga teacher with some side hustles. I run a little webshop and I work as a chef or a hostess in the catering business. I love my partner who lives oversees like he’s Romeo and I am Juliette. I love my two beautiful daughters. 

Amsterdam people are free, funny and friendly. Come on over and leave your footprint in this great travelers hub called Amsterdam.

Whether you are visiting Amsterdam for the first time or you have visited it before, you will always
find something new in this city full of history. Let us introduce you to this magnificent place in
another way!

We are Maria and Aurora. We met years ago in this same amazing and fabulous city, a city where
dreams come true. Here's something about us too:
I am Maria and I am an aspiring illustrator and I am also a mother. I have a Master Degree in plastic arts , fine arts and art history. After spending time abroad, I decided to stay and live in Holland. Apart from my love for art, I have always dreamed of having a small hotel where I can meet interesting people. What could be better than to be in such a fabulous and artistic city as Amsterdam! I have been away from this wonderful city and country for a short time. But it didn't take long before I came back to Amsterdam to rediscover it. Anyone who has been to Amsterdam one time, always comes back!

I am Aurora and I am a fashion branding manager and PR expert. Fashion is my passion. I have more than 15 years experience in the fashion retail industry and B2B events. I have developed several PR activities for fashion showrooms, international designers, brands, individual press shows and shows for fashion platforms. In addition to my professional love for fashion, I, as a mother, love home comfort and want to pass this love on to you and make you feel at home.

Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Hoofddorppleinbuurt,22,23,"['email', 'phone']",t,f,"Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Netherlands",Centrum-Oost,,52.37115,4.91322,Room in serviced apartment,Hotel room,2,,1 private bath,,1.0,[],$217.00,1,1125,1,3,7,7,1.2,7.0,,t,9,37,66,190,2023-12-12,21,5,1,2019-08-19,2023-11-19,4.86,4.95,5.0,4.9,4.76,5.0,4.48,Exempt,t,22,4,12,0,0.4

I love to socialize and make new friends around the world.  I see Airbnb as one of the good platforms to do this. I would be happy to inform you about the many touristic, historical & cultural activities in Amsterdam. When it is possible, I could help make your planning during your stay.  Some touristic flyers are also available. 

If I am free, I would not mind to join you for sight-seeing and showing you around. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Closer to home I love Vlieland in September, and the Netherlands for camping out. And train and boats to Madrid, BXL, Swiss and Crete..

I was lucky to get a chance to live in this house in the nineties: a small floor just for me with everything I needed. Then two friends came to live with me and we got another floor. And then I got the chance to redo the whole house (2nd, 3rd and 4th floor) with my father Bram and his mate Dion in 2011. The house gets to stay another 100 years!

My house is now the most beautiful loft-house in Amsterdam. A bit hippy. You might want to have a glass with me at the rooftop. I'll think about it ;)

I spend my time between Amsterdam and Lisbon. If I am in Lisbon , my son Edo looks after the house in Amsterdam and I manage a studio that we rent out on a beautiful cliff overlooking the sea just south of Lisbon. 

In Amsterdam, everybody wanted to live on the canals growing up but today the area has been overtaken by noise and partying people. Our house in Amsterdam South became the place to live with very good restaurants,  great shops, Concerthall and all the Musea around the corner including the convenient Airport Shuttle bus 397 which takes and brings you direct from the airport, only a few minute walk from my house. A lot of my guests take a morning jog in the nearby Vondelpark....

I have lived for twenty years abroad and returned  4years ago.
Before that I have been a stewardess with KLM for fourteen years so I can say receiving people comes natural to me :-) and  it is most important that my quests feel at home.

I hope to welcome you in the near future.....

I love Amsterdam it's an amazing city. As a well traveled expat from the UK I can say you will enjoy Amsterdam also! It is hard not to. 

I'm married to a New Zealander and have an 11 year old stepdaughter. We enjoy the neighbourhood immensely. There is so much to do at a stones throw away even for the little ones. Within 1km we have 2 parks and NUMEROUS play grounds.  

I'm a designer and so love the inspiration the city has to offer. Museum Square is a 6 minute bike/22 minutes walk away. Offering world class museums - Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh museum, Stedelijk and Moco.
